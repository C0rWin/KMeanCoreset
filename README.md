k-Means for Streaming and Distributed Big Sparse Data
===

Introduction
---

In this repository we provide Matlab implementation of coreset algorithms, used
for evaluation in following paper:

> ** k-Means for Streaming and Distributed Big Sparse Data **
> Artem Barger, and Dan Feldman
> Proceedings of the 2016 SIAM International Conference on Data
> Mining. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 2016.

Algorithms
---

We provide implemenation for three algorithms used in the paper above:

1. Uniform coreset
2. Non-uniform corest (sensitivity based)
3. Our algorithm (Deterministic coreset construction)
